# Isomorphism(Iso) â€“ Using the Monocle library

An Iso is an optic which converts elements of type S into elements of type A without loss.  Like all types in the 
Monocle library you can compose Isos with any other Lens type using `composeIso`.

## Iso Laws
  1. get - Where types A and B are Isomorphic, this law verifies that you can convert any A into a B without loss 
  1. reverse-get -  Where the same types A and B are Isomorphic, this law verifies that you can convert from any B to any A without loss.
